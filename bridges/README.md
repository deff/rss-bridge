RSS-Bridge custom bridges
===============

These bridges allow DMME to get new posts much easier, but require installing and using RSS-Bridge on your server if you don't want to use mine.

Installing RSS-Bridge
===================

 - [RSS-Bridge](https://github.com/sebsauvage/rss-bridge)

The installation and setup of RSS-Bridge is out of scope of this README.

Adding the custom bridges
===================

Copy the provided files in the "bridges/" folder. You don't have to copy all of them: if you only need support for Konachan, then you can just copy "KonachanBridge.php".

Setting up DMME
===================

Refer to README.md in parent folder

Enjoy !
